### Android

Consider [encrpyting your phone](http://www.howtogeek.com/141953/how-to-encrypt-your-android-phone-and-why-you-might-want-to/). It's easy!

#### Messaging

- Use [TextSecure](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms)
to encrypt SMSes to your friends who also use it, and send regular SMSes to others.
- Or, alternatively, use [Wickr](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mywickr.wickr2).[^wickr] 

#### Phone calls

- Encrypt important phone calls using
[RedPhone](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.redphone). Not suitable for everyday calls.

### iPhone

#### Messaging

- Use [Signal](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id874139669) to send encrypted messages.
- Use [Wickr](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/wickr/id528962154?mt=8) to send encrypted messages.[^wickr]

### Notes
[^wickr]: If it's good enough for [Government Frontbenchers](http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australia-news-blog/2015/mar/02/wickr-the-secret-messaging-app-of-the-party-unfaithful), it's good enough for you!
