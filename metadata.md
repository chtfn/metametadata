The law is called the _Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment
(Data Retention) Bill 2015_.

### What is metadata?
Metadata is data about data. Imagine we have the following data:

|Name      | Age |
|:----     |:--- |
|Tony      | 57  |
|Joe       | 49  |
|Julie     | 58  |
|Warren    | 66  |

The metadata of this table would say that there are four
people that the table describes. This is a description of the
description, the data of the data. Sounds innocent enough, right?

#### Metadata about communication
One of the major types of metadata that will be collected under this
new law is communication metadata. In communication terms, metadata
is information about the piece of communication being sent, without
including the contents of the communication itself.

Image that, every time you sent a letter, the following was recorded:

- the address it's being sent to,
- the return address,
- the stamp used,
- the weight of the letter,
- the colour of the ink used to mark the envelope, 
- the type of envelope. 

This captures some of what is covered by capture of communications metadata, except that
some other things might be catured, like

- the physical location where the communication was sent from,
- the location of where the recipient's mail is,
- what application you were using when you sent the data,
- the operating system of the device that you are using.

#### Metadata about website visits
Another type of metadata that will be captured and stored is data about
which websites you have visited, including those you've accessed using
your browser's private mode.
