Imagine the Australian government sent an agent to watch over your shoulder
as you used the computer 

The Australian government are pushing through a bill, blandly called 
the _Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment
(Data Retention) Bill 2015_. This is a direct attack on your right to
privacy, and may be used by a government

## <a name="what"></a>What is metadata?
Metadata is data about data. Imagine we have the following data:

<div align="center">
    <table class="table table-striped table-hover">
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Age</th>
        </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Tony</td>
            <td>57</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Joe</td>
            <td>49</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Julie</td>
            <td>58</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Warren</td>
            <td>66</td>
          </tr>
    </table>
</div>

The metadata of this table would say that there are four
people that the table describes. This is a description of the
description; the data of the data. Sounds innocent enough, right?

### Metadata about communication
In communication terms, metadata
is information about the piece of communication being sent, without
including the contents of the communication itself.

Image that, every time you sent a letter, the following was recorded:

- the address it's being sent to,
- the return address,
- the stamp used,
- the weight of the letter,
- the colour of the ink used to mark the envelope, 
- the type of envelope. 

This captures some of what is covered by capture of communications metadata, except that
some other things might be catured, like

- the physical location where the communication was sent from,
- the location of where the recipient's mail is,
- what application you were using when you sent the data,
- the operating system of the device that you are using.

### Metadata about website visits
