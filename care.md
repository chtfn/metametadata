### <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-sunglasses"></span> Everyone has something to hide. <a name="hide"></a>
It's that old chestnut. _If you've got nothing to <strong>hide</strong>, you've got nothing to <strong>fear</strong>._

If you believe you have nothing to hide, post the passwords to your social media accounts and email somewhere online, so that anyone,
at any time, can access them without your knowledge. Record all your phone calls while you're at it, and upload them, too.

Did you scoff at this suggestion? That's because it's ridiculous.

Did it make you nervous? That's because it's terrifying.

Everyone has stuff that they'd rather stayed private. We place so much trust in the scruples of email providers, telcos, and companies
like Google, Twitter and Facebook, that we don't notice just how much private information we transmit daily. 
There's obvious stuff: your home address, your phone number, your credit card details, your location at any given time.
But what about details regarding your health? What about details of legal counsel? What about opinions on sensitive issues that
you wish to keep to yourself?

__One of the greatest victories of this campaign is to say that people only want to hide _illegal_ things. People want to hide
all sorts of things for all sorts of reasons.__
Here are some things you might want to hide, and how metadata can reveal more than you'd like to disclose[^eff]:

- They know you rang a phone sex service at 2:24 am and spoke for 18 minutes. But they don't know what you talked about.
- They know you called the suicide prevention hotline from the Storey Bridge. But the topic of the call remains a secret.
- They know you spoke with an HIV testing service, then your doctor, then your health insurance company in the same hour. But they don't know what was discussed.

Imagine that your car had a computer inside it that constantly recorded your speed, and your location, and it was
stored for perpetuity. Police forces could look at the log and charge you for every time you exceeded the speed
limit of your geographic location.

Now imagine you do something perfectly legal today, but a record exists of that, and it is deemed illegal in five
years' time. There is nothing in this law that stops you from being __retroactively accessed__ given a certain
misdemeanour. As put by an anonymous police informant,[^police] 

>[All it would take is] simple lobbying by a financial backer of political parties to make copyright seen as
theft and bang so many Aussies caught up criminally. Who's to say access wouldn't be back-dated?

__The policies of the Government of the day change rapidly. Politicians are fickle. But your metadata record remains consistent.
All that stands between you and criminality are easily flipped policy switches.__

### <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-usd"></span> We don't know how much it costs. <a name="cost"></a>
The Abbott Government was elected as a fiscally responsible consort of fiscal fixers. Yet, they haven't costed this legislation.
The Prime Minister [has stated](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-02-18/data-retention-plan-could-cost-almost-400-million-a-year/6139078)
that the cost is around $400m, and that the Government contribution to that will be "significant". But there _will_ be a shortfall,
which will be passed on to you, the consumer.

Paying to be spied on. Sounds wonderful, doesn't it?
