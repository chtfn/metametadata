There are plenty of tools that you can use to make your privacy more secure, and that are
__completely legal__ and __simple to use__.

- [Protect your phone](#phone)
- [Protect your email](#email)
- [Protect your internet traffic](#traffic)

## <a name="phone"></a><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-phone"></span> Protect your phone

- One of the simplest things you can do is to disable the GPS on your phone, which is constantly
leaking details about your location to applications which request that data.
While it's slightly less convinent, remember that most of the communications
that are sent from your phone (Tweets, for example) can include information on your precise location. When you
need to get directions you can just switch it back on.

### Android

- Consider [encrpyting your phone](http://www.howtogeek.com/141953/how-to-encrypt-your-android-phone-and-why-you-might-want-to/). It's easy!

#### Messaging

- Use [TextSecure](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms)
to encrypt SMSes to your friends who also use it, and send regular SMSes to others.
- Or, alternatively, use [Wickr](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mywickr.wickr2).[^wickr]

#### Phone calls

- Encrypt important phone calls using
[RedPhone](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.redphone). Not suitable for everyday calls.

### iPhone

#### Messaging

- Use [Signal](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id874139669) to send encrypted messages.
- Use [Wickr](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/wickr/id528962154?mt=8) to send encrypted messages.[^wickr]

## <a name="email"></a><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-envelope"></span> Protect your email

### Don't use ISP email addresses
One of the simplest ways to get around your data being retained is to use email services hosted by
overseas companies, such as the little-known [Gmail](https://www.gmail.com).

__But__, nothing on the internet is free. If you want really secure mail that doesn't rely on the
revenue of your mail being read for targeted advertisements, check out these paid services that are
big on privacy:

- [KolabNow](https://kolabnow.com/) (hosted in Switzerland for extra security)
- [Hushmail](https://www.hushmail.com/)

### Encrypt your email
It might seem imposingly difficult, but encrypting (or at least signing) your email is actually incredibly
easy, thanks to tools that largely take care of the heavy lifting for you.

## <a name="traffic"></a><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-random"></span> Protect your internet traffic
A [lot](http://wtfismyip.com/) of information about you is sent when you connect to a website.
There are different ways to protect that information, or obscure it.

### Connect using https
Most large websites allow you to connect using technology that encrypts the contents of your internet
traffic. To force websites that have this capability to use it, install the
[HTTPS Everywhere addon](https://www.eff.org/Https-everywhere) to your browser.

Before sending private data, make sure HTTPS is enabled by checking for a <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-lock"></span>
icon somewhere near your browser's address bar.

### Tor
[Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) is a service which protects your anonymity. The basic idea is that,
instead of connecting directly to a website's server, your traffic is sent through a number of different
servers, so that the origin of the request (that is, your machine's location) is obscured. For most users,
using
the [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en), which looks and acts just like
Firefox, will be enough.

### Use a VPN
A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is technology that allows you to connect to a remote machine as if that
machine were in the same network. What this means is that your traffic is sent through this remote machine,
instead of through the network you are connected to.[^vpn]

If you go to/work at a University, chances are you have access to a VPN. You can use this VPN to bypass
metadata retention, as Universities are exempt from the laws, despite their being ISPs.

Otherwise, you might consider paying for an overseas VPN server. They're largely inexpensive ($5--10 per month), but
they provide a high degree of security, and protect your data. We recommend [Mullvad](https://www.mullvad.net/en/), but
don't take our word for it: look around and see which services suit you.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<strong>Heads up!</strong> A VPN doesn't protect your anonymity, and your traffic is still susceptible to traffic
analysis. Tor is much more appropriate if anonymity is your goal.

### Notes
[^wickr]: If it's good enough for [Government Frontbenchers](http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australia-news-blog/2015/mar/02/wickr-the-secret-messaging-app-of-the-party-unfaithful), it's good enough for you!
[^vpn]: By the way, this stuff is especially useful on public, open networks, such as those at cafes or libraries. With easy-to-use tools (like [Firesheep](https://codebutler.github.io/firesheep/)), your social media accounts can be hijacked.
